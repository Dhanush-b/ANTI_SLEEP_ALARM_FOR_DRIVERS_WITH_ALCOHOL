# Anti Sleep Alarm for Drivers with Alcohol Detector


## Project Overview
Drowsiness is a significant cause of accidents worldwide, especially among drivers who are fatigued or lack sufficient sleep. This project aims to provide a technical solution to enhance driver safety by detecting drowsiness and alerting the driver before a potential accident occurs.

## Abstract
Our system detects driver drowsiness using eye blink detection. The system consists of two stages:
1. An alert system that warns the driver through a buzzer.
2. A fail-safe mechanism that cuts off power to the vehicle's motor if the driver remains drowsy, bringing the vehicle to a stop.

## Features
- Eye blink frequency analysis for drowsiness detection.
- Real-time alert system with a buzzer.
- Fail-safe mechanism to stop the vehicle in case of prolonged drowsiness.
- Alcohol detection to prevent the vehicle from starting if alcohol is detected.

## Components
- **Arduino Nano**: Microcontroller used to process the data from sensors.
- **Relay Module**: Used to control the motor based on the microcontroller's signal.
- **Buzzer**: Audio signaling device to alert the driver.
- **IR Sensor**: Detects obstacles and ensures proper operation of the system.
- **Eye Blink Sensor**: Monitors the driver's eye blinks to determine drowsiness.
- **BO Motor**: Represents the vehicle's motor controlled by the system.
- **MQ3 Sensor**: Alcohol sensor to detect the presence of alcohol, enhancing the safety system.
- **NRF24L01**: Wireless module for communication between different parts of the system.

1. **Eye Blink Detection**: The eye blink sensor continuously monitors the driver's eye blinks. If the blink frequency indicates drowsiness, the Arduino Nano processes this data.
   - **Alerting**: The buzzer is activated to alert the driver.
   - **Fail-safe Mechanism**: If the driver does not respond, the relay cuts off power to the motor, safely stopping the vehicle.

2. **Alcohol Detection**: The MQ3 alcohol sensor checks for the presence of alcohol in the driver's breath.
   - **Prevention Mechanism**: If alcohol is detected, the Arduino Nano prevents the motor from starting, ensuring the vehicle remains stationary.
